## Wall setup thoughts

When you have setup openGrid on your wall you normally will want to attach things like shelves and
holders. Attaching those to your board can be done using direct custom snaps. However for this quickstart
tutorial we will be using the Multiconnect system. That is independent from openGrid, supports
different solutions like HSW or Multiboard, but also has great support with openGrid as well.

The main advantages of Multiconnect for this quickstart guide are:

* Easy setup and usage.
* Allows you to move any accessories pretty easily.
* Allows you to reuse existing accessories (for some cases).

## Multiconnect

The multiconnect system is based on a simple connector head you can then use to mount anything to your
board. It works best when gravity is involved (like when you have the board mounted onto your wall), but
is also suitable for other cases.

To attach something to your board using Multiconnect you basically just slide the accessory back over the
Multiconnect heads attached to your board. The model itself must include the multiconnect channels for this,
model authors can use the modeling files to easily create compatible models.

## Snaps 

Multiconnect on openGrid by default is build using two separate parts you can then screw together:
* The snap itself
* The Multiconnect head

Using those two parts allows you to combine different properties to get something that is best fit for
your use case.

For the sake of simplicity for this quickstart tutorial we will be using:
* The normal Multiconnect Snap
* The normal Multiconnect screw

You can then just push those into the openGrid tiles, they will be held in place by the board.

## Adding the accessories

For this quick intro we are using the Gridfinity shelves. There are many different models, but those
are again easy to understand and print.

After you have printed the models you may just slide those over the snaps. I recommend using at least one 
Multiconnect on each of the top corners, but you may want to add as many as you like.

And basically thats it. openGrid has many different models you can choose from. If anything is missing the
CAD files are provided as the base to create your own additions.

Have fun printing and using openGrid!
